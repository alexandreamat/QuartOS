# üîÑ QuartOS

Welcome to the QuartOS repository! This open-source project is designed to provide a comprehensive financial management solution with advanced features including transaction consolidation, support for multiple currencies and countries, connection to various banks through Plaid, manual provisioning with CSV files, and generation of insightful PL reports.

The term QuartOS has its roots in the Catalan language, as elderly people often refer to money as _quartos_ (pronounced /Ààkwa…æ.tus/). It embodies a sense of tradition and heritage while also signifying modern financial management practices.

## Features

### üè¶ Plaid Integration

Seamlessly connects to multiple banks through the Plaid API, allowing for automatic data fetching from financial institutions.

### üñêÔ∏è Manual Provisioning

Enables users to upload transaction files provided by their financial institutions in CSV format. This feature is ideal for banks not supported by Plaid or for users in different geographic regions.

### üí± Multi-Currency Support

Accommodates transactions in various currencies and from different countries, ensuring flexibility for users globally.

### üîÑ Transaction Consolidation

Offers transaction consolidation functionality, bundling transactions together that belong to a single financial event. This process helps clean transaction data and accurately calculate the net worth impact.

### ü™£ Support for Bucket Accounting

Allows users to create virtual accounts to partition transactions, regardless of the actual financial bank account. This feature is ideal for managing side hustles or shared expenses efficiently.

### üè∑Ô∏è Categorization of Transaction Data

Automatically categorizes transaction data based on categories provided by Plaid, which can be edited by the user to suit their needs and preferences.

### üìä Generation of Insightful Reports

Generates P&L (Profit and Loss) reports on a yearly, monthly, weekly, and quarterly basis, showcasing income and expenses. Reports can be generated by bucket or overall, with support for visualization of categorization into various expense categories.
